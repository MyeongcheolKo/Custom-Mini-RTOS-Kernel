sem_post_fifo.c

Demonstrates os_sem_post() with a FIFO semaphore: a task blocked in
os_sem_wait() is woken by another task posting the semaphore, and the wait
returns OS_OK instead of timing out. With FIFO, each post releases whichever
task has been waiting longest, regardless of task priority.

See sem_post_priority.c for the same mechanism with PRIORITY unblocking, where
the wait list is drained by task priority instead of arrival order.

Tasks:
  consumer1, priority 1, os_sem_wait(&sem, 5000) -> blocks until posted
  consumer2, priority 2, os_sem_wait(&sem, 5000) -> blocks until posted
  producer,  priority 3, os_task_delay(1000) then os_sem_post(&sem)

sem is created with initial count 0 (os_sem_create(&sem, 0, FIFO)), so both
consumers block immediately at startup and sit in the semaphore's wait list.
The producer is the lowest priority task on purpose: it only reaches its first
os_task_delay() after both consumers have already queued up, so the wait list
is populated before any post happens.

The consumers' 5000 tick timeout is 5x the producer's 1000 tick post period, so
a post always arrives long before the timeout could expire. A "TIMED OUT" line
in the output would therefore mean something is broken, not a normal outcome.

Observed ITM/SWO output (repeats):
Task schedular initialized
Consumer 1: waiting on semaphore     <- highest priority, so it queues first
Consumer 2: waiting on semaphore
Producer: posting semaphore          <- fires after its 1000 tick delay
Consumer 1: semaphore acquired       <- FIFO released the head of the wait list
Consumer 1: waiting on semaphore     <- re-queues, now behind consumer2
Producer: posting semaphore
Consumer 2: semaphore acquired       <- consumer2 is at the head now
Consumer 2: waiting on semaphore
Producer: posting semaphore
Consumer 1: semaphore acquired
Consumer 1: waiting on semaphore
  ...

- every wait ends in "semaphore acquired", never "TIMED OUT", proving the post
  path unblocks a waiter and that os_sem_wait() reports OS_OK for it.
- the two consumers alternate rather than one starving, proving each post
  releases exactly one waiter and that FIFO releases them in the order they
  blocked.
- consumer1 outranks consumer2 but still has to take its turn. That is the
  whole point of FIFO: release order is a property of the wait list, not of
  task priority. Under PRIORITY unblocking consumer1 would win every post and
  consumer2 would starve.

NOTE: unlike round_robin_priority.c, this app never has two tasks runnable at
the same time (a consumer only wakes when the producer posts, and the producer
prints before posting), so printf output does not braid together here even
though printf is not atomic or reentrant.
