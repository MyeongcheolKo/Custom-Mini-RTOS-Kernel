mutex_priority_donate.c

Demonstrates priority inheritance: without it, a low priority task holding the 
mutex with a medium-priority task that never touches the mutex can starve a high 
priority task waiting for the mutex indefinitely, because the scheduler never lets 
the low priority mutex run to finishing using the mutex and unlock it. With inheritance, 
the low-priority owner is temporarily boosted to the waiting high priority task's priority, 
so the owner can finish and unlock.

Tasks:
  task1 "H", priority 1 (highest)
  task2 "M", priority 2
  task3 "L", priority 3 (lowest)

Since H and M are higher priority than L, both delays on entry to stage the 
scenario to let L grab the mutex first.

Sequence:
    1. L runs while H and M are still delaying, locks mtx, and starts a long busy_spin 
        to simulate holding it while doing some work.
    2. t=50 M wakes, preempts L (M's priority 2 beats L's 3), and enters its 
        print + busy_spin loop. M never blocks again after this, so it would run 
        forever and L would never get the CPU back on its own.
    3. t=100 H wakes, preempts M, and calls os_mutex_lock(&mtx, OS_WAIT_FOREVER).
        mtx is still held by L, so H blocks and because H's priority (1) beats L's
        current effective priority (3), L's effective priority is boosted to 1.
    4. That boost breaks the inversion: L (now priority 1) outranks M (priority 2), 
        so the scheduler runs L instead of M. L resumes its busy_spin exactly where 
        it was preempted and eventually finishes it.
    5. L unlocks mtx. Ownership hands off to H, L's effective priority reverts to
        its base (3). H becomes both the new owner and the highest priority ready 
        task, so the scheduler switches straight to H. 
    6. H acquires the mutex and halts in while(1)

Expected ITM/SWO output: 
Task schedular initialized
Task L: locking mutex
Task L: mutex acquired
Task M: running
Task H: locking mutex       <- H wakes at t=100, waits for mutex, boosts L to priority 1
Task L: unlocking mutex     <- L, now boosted, finally gets to finish and unlock
Task H: mutex acquired

Output without priority inheritance would be:
Task schedular initialized
Task L: locking mutex
Task L: mutex acquired
Task M: running
Task H: locking mutex
Task M: running
Task M: running
Task M: running
... (keeps repeating "Task M: running" forever)
