sem_timeout.c

Demonstrates the kernel's semaphore timeout behavior: a task blocked on
os_sem_wait() unblocks on its own once its timeout expires, instead of
blocking forever, and os_sem_wait() reports that as OS_SEM_UNAVAILABLE.

Tasks:
  task1, priority 1, os_sem_wait(&sem, 500)  -> highest priority, times out first
  task2, priority 2, os_sem_wait(&sem, 1000) -> times out second
  task3, priority 3, os_sem_wait(&sem, 1500) -> lowest priority, times out last

sem is created with initial count 0 (os_sem_create(&sem, 0, FIFO)) and is
never posted anywhere in this app. That means every os_sem_wait() call is
guaranteed to time out, there is no path where the semaphore is actually
acquired.

Each task waits with a different timeout (500, 1000, 1500 ticks), so the three "timed out"
messages appear staggered rather than together, proving each task's wakeup_tick is
tracked and expired independently rather than sharing one global timeout.

Expected ITM/SWO output (repeats):
Task schedular initialized
This is task 1                          <- highest priority (1) runs first
This is task 2
This is task 3
Task 1: semaphore wait timed out        <- task1's 500 tick timeout fires first
This is task 1                             
Task 1: semaphore wait timed out        <- task1 cycles again 500 ticks later
This is task 1
Task 2: semaphore wait timed out        <- task2's 1000 tick timeout fires
This is task 2
Task 1: semaphore wait timed out        <- task1 cycles a 3rd time
This is task 1
Task 3: semaphore wait timed out        <- task3's 1500 tick timeout finally fires
This is task 3
Task 1: semaphore wait timed out        <- task1 cycles again
This is task 1
  ...

- every wait ends in "semaphore wait timed out", never "semaphore acquired",
  proving the timeout path fires correctly when the semaphore is never posted.
- task1 shows up more often than task2 (1000 tick timeout) and task3 (1500 tick timeout) 
  since its timeout is shortest(500 tick timeout), proving wakeup_tick is tracked 
  independently per task rather than off one shared timer.
- task1 also benefits from being highest priority, whenever it and a lower
  priority task become READY on the same tick, task1 preempts and prints
  first, so task2/task3 only print once task1 is blocked again.

NOTE: printf is neither atomic nor reentrant, and the kernel is preemptive, so 
the expected output is just what a typical cycle looks like, the exact order can 
shift slightly run to run, since printf's own execution time isn't perfectly constant
