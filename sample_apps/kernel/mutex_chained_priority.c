mutex_chained_priority.c

Demonstrates chained priority inheritance: task H wants mtx1, held by task M,
but M is itself blocked waiting on mtx2, held by task L. A working chained priority 
inheritance boosts M and propagate that boost to L, not just the immediate owner. Task X
is a medium priority task that never blocks, standing for anything that would starve L 
forever without inheritance. If L is boosted, X's output visibly pauses. If L is not, 
X prints forever and L never finishes.

Phase 1 (donation): H waits forever -> proves the boost reaches L, two hops away.
Phase 2 (release): H times out -> proves the boost on L is undone once H gives up.

Tasks:
  taskH, priority 1 (highest)
  taskX, priority 2 
  taskM, priority 3 
  taskL, priority 4 (lowest)

Sequence, phase 1 (donation):
    1. L runs first (H/X/M all delays on entry), locks mtx2, and starts a long
        busy_spin to simulate holding it while working.
    2. M wakes, locks mtx1, then tries to lock mtx2 (held by L) with OS_WAIT_FOREVER, 
        so it now blocks. M now owns mtx1 while itself blocked on mtx2.
    3. X wakes and starts printing, checking between prints whether H has signaled 
        phase1_done_sem yet (nonblocking, timeout == 0). L isn't boosted yet,
        so X (priority 2) preempts L (priority 4). X dominates, L makes no progress.
    4. H wakes and calls os_mutex_lock(&mtx1, OS_WAIT_FOREVER). Since mtx1 is held by M,
        so H blocks. M is boosted directly to H's priority. Because M is itself
        BLOCKED_MUTEX on mtx2, the boost must also propagate to mtx2's owner, L.
    5. If L was correctly boosted to priority 1, it now beats X and preempts it,
        resuming and finishing its busy_spin, then unlocking mtx2. If not, X continues 
        to run forever and L never finishes.
    6. Ownership of mtx2 transfers to M. M finishes quickly, unlocks mtx2, then unlocks mtx1.
    7. H acquires mtx1 and immediately unlocks it again, then signals Z using the phase1_done_sem
        and delays to let L and M lock mtx1 and mtx2 again for phase 2.

Phase 2 setup:
    8. X recieves the phase1_done_sem signal and delays to let L and M lock mtx1 and mtx2 
        again for phase 2.
    9. M, delays to let L lock mtx2 first.
    10. L locks mtx2, then busy spins.
    11. M preempts L and locks mtx1, then M tries to lock mtx2 and blocks again.
    12. X resumes its loop and prints "Task X: running".

Sequence, phase 2 (release):
    13. H delay passes and calls os_mutex_lock(&mtx1, 100) this time. mtx1 is held by M,
        so H blocks, triggering the same propagated boost. M and L both go to priority 1.
        L preempts X again.
    14. L's busy spin this round outlasts H's 100 ticks timeout on purpose, so H's wait
        expires before L's busy spin. H's os_mutex_lock returns OS_ERR_UNAVAILABLE, and H is
        removed from mtx1's waitlist.
    15.  The release path now recomputes priority. M is directly reachable from where H left,
        so M correctly drops back to its base priority even with a unchained recompute. 
        However, L is two hops away. If the release path chains outward the same way donation 
        did, L also drops back to its base priority, X preempts it again, and "Task X: running" 
        resumes. If the release path only ever touches the immediate owner, L stays stuck
        boosted at priority 1 forever and X never prints again. 
    16. H delays for 10 ticks, lets M print "Task X: running" a few times, then the app ends with while(1).

Expected ITM/SWO output:
Task schedular initialized
Task L: locking mtx2
Task L: mtx2 acquired
Task M: locking mtx1
Task M: mtx1 acquired
Task M: locking mtx2
Task X: running    <- X resumes, preempts L, proves L is not boosted yet
... ("Task X: running" repeats)
Task X: running
Task H: locking mtx1 (phase 1 timout==forever)    <- boosts M, then chains to boost L
Task L: unlocking mtx2    <- L wins over X now, finishes and unlocks
Task M: mtx2 acquired
Task M: unlocking mtx2
Task M: unlocking mtx1    <- hands mtx1 to H
Task H: mtx1 acquired (phase 1 done)
Task H: unlocking mtx1
Task L: locking mtx2
Task L: mtx2 acquired
Task M: locking mtx1
Task M: mtx1 acquired
Task M: locking mtx2
Task X: running    <- X resumes, preempts L
... ("Task X: running" repeats)
Task X: running
Task H: locking mtx1 (phase 2 timeout==100)    <- boosts M, chains to boost L, X goes quiet
Task H: mtx1 lock timed out (phase 2 done)
Task X: running    <- L was released all the way, X is free again
Task X: running
...
