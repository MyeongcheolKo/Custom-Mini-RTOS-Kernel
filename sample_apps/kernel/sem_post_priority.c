sem_post_priority.c

Demonstrates os_sem_post() with a PRIORITY semaphore: each post scans the wait
list and releases the highest priority waiter, regardless of how long anyone
has been waiting.

See sem_post_fifo.c for the same mechanism with FIFO unblocking, where the wait
list is drained in arrival order instead.

Tasks:
  consumer_high, priority 1, os_task_delay(300) then os_sem_wait(&sem, 5000)
  consumer_mid,  priority 2, os_task_delay(200) then os_sem_wait(&sem, 5000)
  consumer_low,  priority 3, os_task_delay(100) then os_sem_wait(&sem, 5000)
  producer,      priority 4, os_task_delay(500) then os_sem_post(&sem) x3

The staggered entry delays are the whole trick. Left alone, the scheduler runs
the highest priority task first, so consumers would queue up in priority order
and a FIFO semaphore and a PRIORITY semaphore would produce identical output,
proving nothing. The delays invert that: consumer_low reaches os_sem_wait()
first (t=100), then consumer_mid (t=200), then consumer_high (t=300), so the
wait list ends up in the exact reverse of priority order:

  wait list by arrival:  [low, mid, high]
  released by PRIORITY:   high, mid, low   <- reversed, so ordering came from
                                              priority and not from arrival

The producer waits 500 ticks so all three consumers are queued before it posts,
then posts three times back to back to drain the whole list in one go. Because
os_sem_post() yields, each post switches to the task it just released before
the next post runs, so the releases show up in the output one at a time.

The consumers' 5000 tick timeout is far longer than the ~400 ticks any of them
actually waits, so a "TIMED OUT" line means something is broken.

Expected ITM/SWO output (repeats):
Task schedular initialized
Consumer LOW (priority 3): waiting on semaphore     <- queues FIRST
Consumer MID (priority 2): waiting on semaphore
Consumer HIGH (priority 1): waiting on semaphore    <- queues LAST
Producer: posting semaphore 3 times
Consumer HIGH (priority 1): semaphore acquired      <- released FIRST
Consumer MID (priority 2): semaphore acquired
Consumer LOW (priority 3): semaphore acquired       <- released LAST
Consumer LOW (priority 3): waiting on semaphore     <- cycles back to wait again
Consumer MID (priority 2): waiting on semaphore
Consumer HIGH (priority 1): waiting on semaphore
Producer: posting semaphore 3 times
  ...

- the release order(HIGH, MID, LOW) is the exact reverse of the arrival order 
  (LOW, MID, HIGH), which only a priority scan can produce. Under FIFO this same 
  app would aquire semephores in the order LOW, MID, HIGH instead, the same order 
  as the arrival order.
- three posts release exactly three waiters, one each, proving os_sem_post()
  releases a single task per call rather than draining or broadcasting.
- consumer_low is not starved here only because the producer posts as many
  times as there are waiters. If it posted once per round, PRIORITY would hand
  every post to consumer_high and consumer_low, consumer_mid would never run, which 
  is the starvation tradeoff FIFO avoids.

NOTE: like sem_post_fifo.c, this app never has two tasks runnable at the same
time (consumers only wake when posted or when their delay expires, and the
producer prints before posting), so printf output does not braid together even
though printf is not atomic or reentrant.
